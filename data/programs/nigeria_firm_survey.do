									Round 1
question1: Do you own and operate your own business?
question2: How often have you experienced power outages at your business in the last year?
question3: Suppose that power outages were permanently eliminated in Nigeria. How likely would this be to raise the average profits of your business in the coming years?
question4: Suppose that power outages are permanently eliminated across Nigeria. How likely would this be to raise the number of other businesses operating in your industry?
question5: Suppose that you could pay N150,000 to permanently eliminate power outages at your business. Would be likely to do so?
